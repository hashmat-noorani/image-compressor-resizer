In this Image Resizer & Compressor tool, users can upload an image and resize its width & height or reduce its size(from 10%-100%) with slider. If they checked the “Lock aspect ratio”, the aspect ratio for an image will be calculated automatically and filled in the field as they start changing width or height. Also User can convert image from jpeg to png and vice versa.
And, finally users can download their resized images by clicking on the “Download Image” button.
